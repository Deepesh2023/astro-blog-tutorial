#My first astro post

published on 2024-05-20

welcome to my _new blog_ about learning astro. I will be sharing my experience as i build this website

## What i have acomplished

1. **Installing astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder

3. **Making blog posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Whats next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
